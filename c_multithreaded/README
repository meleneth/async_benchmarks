For a piece of code that claims no tricks, a *multi-threaded* webserver seems a bit heavy.

It reads the client request, and no matter what responds with static HTML.

This is, as it should be, disturbingly fast.

I'm not currently sure why for every request we see MAIN: startup.

It sounds rather like it's running a new copy of the program for each request, which is ludicrous
